# Code Refactoring for Reusability Log

## Task ID: IMPL_SWARM_STARTER_20241019_T3
## Status: Completed

### Actions Taken:
1. Created `config.py` file to store configuration variables:
   - OpenAI API key
   - Default model
   - Agent roles and instructions

2. Created `api_client.py` file to handle OpenAI client initialization:
   - Implemented a function to get the OpenAI client
   - Created a single instance of the client to be used across the application

3. Updated `agents.py` file:
   - Imported necessary modules from `config.py` and `api_client.py`
   - Used `AGENT_ROLES` from `config.py` to define agent instructions
   - Used the `client` from `api_client.py` for API calls
   - Simplified the agent creation process

4. Updated `main.py` file:
   - Imported necessary modules from `config.py`
   - Used `AGENT_ROLES` from `config.py` to display available agent roles
   - Simplified the main loop and error handling

### Current Implementation:

The project now has a more modular structure with the following files:

1. `config.py`: Contains configuration variables
2. `api_client.py`: Handles OpenAI client initialization
3. `agents.py`: Defines the Agent class and get_agent function
4. `main.py`: Implements the main conversation loop

This structure allows for easier maintenance, extension, and testing of the codebase.

### Next Steps:
1. Add logging and error handling (Task ID: IMPL_SWARM_STARTER_20241019_T4)
2. Write unit tests for core functions (Task ID: IMPL_SWARM_STARTER_20241019_T5)
3. Update the README.md file with usage instructions

### Notes:
- The refactoring process has improved the overall structure and maintainability of the project.
- Consider adding more advanced features, such as conversation history or more sophisticated agent selection logic, in future iterations.
