# Logging and Error Handling Implementation Log

## Task ID: IMPL_SWARM_STARTER_20241019_T4
## Status: Completed

### Actions Taken:
1. Created `logger.py` file to set up a custom logger:
   - Implemented `setup_logger` function to create a logger with both file and console handlers
   - Added rotation to file handler to manage log file size

2. Updated `config.py` to include logging configuration:
   - Added `LOG_FILE` and `LOG_LEVEL` variables

3. Modified `api_client.py` to incorporate logging:
   - Added logging for successful client initialization and errors

4. Updated `agents.py` with logging and improved error handling:
   - Added logging for agent creation, message processing, and errors
   - Improved error handling in `get_agent` function

5. Modified `main.py` to include logging and error handling:
   - Added logging for program start, user inputs, agent switching, and errors
   - Improved error handling for agent initialization and conversation loop

### Current Implementation:

The project now has comprehensive logging and error handling across all modules:

1. `logger.py`: Sets up a custom logger with file and console output
2. `config.py`: Includes logging configuration
3. `api_client.py`: Logs API client initialization
4. `agents.py`: Logs agent creation, message processing, and handles errors
5. `main.py`: Logs user interactions, agent switching, and handles errors in the main loop

### Next Steps:
1. Write unit tests for core functions (Task ID: IMPL_SWARM_STARTER_20241019_T5)
2. Update the README.md file with usage instructions

### Notes:
- The logging implementation allows for easier debugging and monitoring of the application's behavior.
- Error handling has been improved to provide more informative messages to users and log detailed error information for developers.
- Consider implementing more granular log levels for different types of events in future iterations.
